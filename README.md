# puzzle-center
An Android application about puzzles. It contains a solve timer, and a selection of algorithms for each puzzle.

About the project
Puzzle Center is one of my passion projects, since I’ve always loved the Rubik’s Cube and solving different kinds of puzzles. The Rubik’s Cube being Hungarian (like myself) also contributes to my craze for twisty puzzles. The Puzzle Center application is an Android app that I am currently developing, which includes a solve time for timing different puzzles, a records page for checking the top 3 best times per category, as well as a more-or-less detailed tutorial for many twisty puzzles (mostly WCA). One of my main objectives was to build an archive of algorithms that I personally use, with the least amount of algorithms possible. That is to say, I try to use algorithms that can be re-used on other puzzles, requiring to learn as few algorithms as possible.

My programming skills
I am a Computer Science student mainly focusing on Java development, so I wrote the application in Java not Kotlin. I always seek new opportunities to learn and improve myself, mobile development was one such opportunity when I took Mobile Development class as an extracurricular subject. This was my first-ever Android project, so it is by no means perfect, may contain bugs etc. Feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions.

Every icon was hand-crafted by me
There are more than 50 (eventually somewhere around 100) icons in the application, all of which was made by me in GIMP. I am no graphics designer so this definitely took more time than it should have.
